# Adam Greatorex Portfolio

Below is a summary of projects / assignments I have worked on whilst enrolled in the 2023 Cambride Spark Data Analyst Bootcamp. The bootcamp divides weekly modules into a mixture of class learning and assignments. This portfolio will demonstrate what I have learnt so far and display further projects I have undertaken, after the course has finised.  It is ordered so my recent projects / assignments appear first.

## [Project 4: Python Functions & Conditionals](https://github.com/adamgreatorex01/portfolio/blob/main/functions%20and%20conditionals%20assignment.ipynb)
- The assignment required me to define functions and then use those functions to solve problems with some datasets.
- The goal was for me to Instantiate and Develop Python Functions and Methods
- During this assignment I developed knowlege in:
- Creating more complex conditional statements within functions
- Returning a dictionary and creating key value pairs, through building a function that takes in a tuple and a string as parameters.
- Creating a function which compares 3 lists and returns a list of items which are not present in the other 2 lists. This could be used in a business sense, to see if a certain id appeared across different levels of a given range.

Throughout this assignment I learnt further skills in:
## [Project 3: Coronavirus Dataset - Functions Assignment](https://github.com/adamgreatorex01/portfolio/blob/main/functions%20coronavirus%20data%20set.ipynb)
- The goal of this assignment was for me to make a set of functions that can be re-used on any CSV file which is in the same format as corona.csv, thus if corona.csv were updated, all of my functions could be re-used to gather the same metrics as before. This project encouarged me to learn how to write re-usable functions and practice skills in:
- Using the .zip function
- Adding comments within functions to explain what is happening and document my own thought process
- Using for loops to iterate through elements
- Utilising conditional statements to to get required values

## [Project 2: Vehicle Dataset](https://github.com/adamgreatorex01/portfolio/blob/main/Vehicle%20Dataset.ipynb) 
- In this project, I analysed a dataset about vehicles and their characteristics. The goal of this project was to preprocess and analyse the data using the pandas library. 
- As this was the 2nd part of using pandas, it was important that I recapped over the previous sessions content and applied these skills into the new dataset. I also explored questions using pandas documentation and visting stack overflow.
- Durning this assignment, I learnt how to drop na values within columns, set a new index for my data frame, create a fucntion that would return a value from the dataset when I entered the vehciles name as an argument.

## [Project 1: Daily stock prices for Apple](https://github.com/adamgreatorex01/portfolio/blob/main/stock%20analysis.ipynb)
- In my first assignment, I analysed a dataset containing historical daily stock prices for Apple.
- The goal of this project was for me to preprocess and analyse data using the pandas library in Python. 
- Within this introductory project, it was important for me to read pandas documentation, inline with answering the given questions. 
- Throughout this project, I learnt new skills such as sorting a dataset based on columns, creating a subset of a dataframe, selecting specific rows, using methods such as idxmax and finding stats including then mean, min and max on the data set.
