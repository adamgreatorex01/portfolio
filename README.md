# Adam Greatorex Portfolio

Below is a summary of projects / assignments I have worked on whilst enrolled in the 2023 Cambride Spark Data Analyst Bootcamp. The bootcamp divides weekly modules into a mixture of class learning and assignments. This portfolio will demonstrate what I have learnt so far and further projects I have undertaken on my own, after the course has finised.  It is ordered so my recent projects / assignments appear first.


## [Project 1: Daily stock prices for Apple](https://github.com/adamgreatorex01/portfolio/blob/main/stock%20analysis.ipynb)
- In my first assignment, I analysed a dataset containing historical daily stock prices for Apple.
- The goal of this project was for me to preprocess and analyse data using the pandas library in Python. 
- Within this introductory project, it was important for me to read pandas documentation, inline with answering the given questions. 
- Throughout this project, I learnt new skills such as sorting a dataset based on columns, creating a subset of a dataframe, selecting specific rows, using methods such as idxmax and finding stats including then mean, min and max on the data set.
