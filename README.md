# portfolio

Below is a brief summary of projects / assignments I have worked on whilst enrolled in the Cambride Spark Data Analyst Bootcamp. The bootcamp divides weekly modules into a mixture of class learning and subsequnet assignments. This portfolio will demonstrate what i have learnt so far, and further projects I have undertaken on my own after the course has finised.  It is ordered so my recent projects / assignments are first.

1. In my first assignment, I analysed a dataset containing historical daily stock prices for Apple.
The goal of this project was for me to preprocess and analyse data using the pandas library in Python. Within this introductory project, it was important for me to read pandas documentation, inline with answering the given questions. Throughout this project, i learnt new skills such as Sorting a dataset based on columns, creating a subset of dataframes, selecting specific rows, using methods such as idxmax and finding stats including mean, min and max.
